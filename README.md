### üìù User Authentication: Sign Up

This screenshot displays the secure user authentication flow for new user registration. The interface is designed to capture essential information while ensuring data integrity.

-   **Form Fields:**
    -   `Email`: Collects the user's email address, which serves as the unique identifier for their account. This will be used for both sign-in and potential password recovery.
    -   `Password`: Accepts the user's desired password. The password input type is masked to ensure privacy.
    -   `Confirm Password`: A validation field to ensure the user has typed their password correctly, preventing common input errors.
-   **Sign Up Button:**
    -   This button initiates a POST request to the backend API (`/api/auth/signup` or similar endpoint).
    -   On the server, a user object is created, the password is hashed using a strong algorithm like bcrypt, and the user's data is stored in the MongoDB database.
-   **"Already have account? Sign In" link:**
    -   A routing link that directs the user to the `Sign In` component. This helps navigate between authentication pages without a full page reload, common in single-page applications (SPAs) built with React.

This process is a critical part of the application's security architecture, ensuring that each user has a unique and protected account before accessing the chat functionalities.

### üßë‚Äçüíº User Profile Information

This image shows the user information form, a crucial step after initial registration, where users can personalize their profile.

-   **Form Fields:**
    -   `First Name`: Captures the user's first name.
    -   `Last Name`: Captures the user's last name.
    -   `Username`: Displays a unique identifier, likely auto-generated or chosen by the user, which can be used for public display and direct messaging.
    -   `Date of Birth`: A date input field that allows the user to specify their birth date, which is stored for demographic and age-based feature access.
    -   `Gender`: A dropdown menu providing predefined options (e.g., Male, Female) for the user to select their gender.
-   **"Done" Button:**
    -   This button submits the collected profile data to the backend.
    -   Upon submission, the server-side logic updates the user's profile document in the MongoDB database, enriching their user profile with this new information.
    -   This action finalizes the registration process, typically redirecting the user to their main dashboard or chat interface.

This profile customization step is key to providing a personalized and more engaging user experience within the application.

-   **Search Bar:**
    -   A prominent input field that allows users to type in a name or username.
    -   As the user types, the application performs a real-time search, likely making an API call to a `/api/users/search` endpoint.
    -   The backend query searches for matching users in the database and returns a list of results.
-   **User List:**
    -   The list displays the results of the search query in a clean, scrollable format.

-   **Functionality:**
    -   Clicking on any user in the list likely redirects the current user to that person's public profile page, where they can view more details and initiate a friend request or follow.

This feature is essential for a social application, as it provides a straightforward method for users to expand their network and engage with others on the platform.
